### Coding Experience

After investigating website-building at various points, I committed to learning it during the first, long lockdown in 2020 when I was lucky enough to receive a bursary from [SuperHi](https://www.superhi.com). Their foundation course in web development and a further course in JavaScript helped me see how web developers make attractive, user-friendly and innovative websites.

### Current Learning

I'm currently building on these foundations in HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the HyperionDev web development bootcamp, which is funded by the Department for Education. I'm almost 80% of the way through, and can clearly see the difference in my JavaScript skills. I'm now much more confident in DOM manipulation, APIs, using JSON, and async programming. I'm looking forward to learning Node and React in the remainder of the course.

### What's Next

Once I'm finished the bootcamp, I'm looking forward to gaining work in this new field. To help me continue developing my skills, next I'm going to learn Python, with a view to using it to build custom-made content-managed sites for clients. After that, I aim to learn how to use Wordpress to build custom sites, including with integrated shops and other features. 

Overall, I aim to have full-stack skills, but with a focus on creating frontends that are well-designed and intuitive, in line with current UX practices.

### Outside Coding

I'm a keen blogger, hiker, writer and textile artist. You can find out more about any of those things on my [personal website](https://www.jessghost.com/) where there is also a contact form if you would like to get in touch.
