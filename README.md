# Jess Ghost/el-spook

I'm Jess, a student web developer in North England with aspirations to become a full stack developer.

## Coding

### Experience

After investigating website-building at various points in the past, I committed to learning it properly during the first, long lockdown in 2020 when I was lucky enough to receive a bursary from [SuperHi](https://www.superhi.com). Their foundation course in web development and a further course in JavaScript helped me understand how web developers make attractive, user-friendly and innovative websites, and the courses showed me what it is possible to make.

### Current Learning

I'm currently building on these foundations in HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the HyperionDev web development bootcamp, which is funded by the Department for Education. I'm almost 80% of the way through, and I can clearly see the difference in my JavaScript skills. I'm now much more confident in DOM manipulation, APIs, using JSON, and async programming. I'm looking forward to learning Node and React in the remainder of the course. Here's one of my recent projects, [a website about the world's most dangerous mountains](https://github.com/el-spook/finalCapstone).

### What's Next

Once I'm finished the bootcamp, I'm looking forward to gaining work in this new field. To help me continue developing my skills, next I'm going to learn Python, with a view to using it to build custom-made content-managed sites for clients. After that, I aim to learn how to use Wordpress to build custom sites, including with integrated shops and other features. 

Overall, I aim to have full-stack skills, but with a focus on creating frontends that are well-designed and intuitive, in line with current UX practices.

## Outside Coding

I'm a blogger, hiker, writer, table-top games player and textile artist. You can find out more about some of these things on my [personal website](https://www.jessghost.com/) where there is also a contact form if you would like to get in touch.
